#Material Theming in Compose(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/themes/material)
- Material Theming is a systematic way to customize Material Design to better reflect your product’s brand.
- A MaterialTheme Composable contains:
	- color
    - typography  and 
	- shape       attributes.
- When you customize these attributes, your changes are automatically reflected in the components you use to build your app.

#Color
- Colors are modelled in Compose with the "Color" class.
- You can define colors using "darkColors()" and "lightColors()"

#Using theme colors
- To retrive Colors provided by "MaterialTheme", MaterialTheme.colors.<colorKey>

#Surface and content color
- Many components accept a pair of color and content color.
- "contentColorFor()" retrives the appropriate "on" color for any theme colors.
- "LocalContentColor" to retrieve the preferred content color for the current background.

#Content Alpha
- You can specify a content alpha for a hierarchy by providing a value for "LocalContentAlpha".
- Apply different levels of emphasis to text to visually communicate the information hierarchy. 
- Material specifies some standard alpha values "high", "medium", "disabled" which are modelled by the ContentAlpha object.
- MaterialTheme defaults LocalContentAlpha to "ContentAlpha.high".

#Dark theme
- "isSystemInDarkTheme()", "MaterialTheme.colors.isLight"

#Elevation overlays
- In Material, surfaces in dark themes with higher elevations receive "elevation overlays", which lightens their background.
- These overlays are applied automatically by the "Surface" composable when using dark colors, and for any other Material composable which uses a surface.
- For custom scenarios that don’t involve a Surface, use "LocalElevationOverlay".
- To disable elevation overlays, provide null at the desired point in a composable hierarchy.4

#Limited color accents
- Material recommends applying limited color accents for dark themes by preferring the use of the surface color over the primary color in most cases.
- For custom scenarios, use the "primarySurface" extension property

#Typography
- Compose implements the type system with the "Typography", "TextStyle", and font-related classes.

#Using text styles
- "MaterialTheme.typography.<textstyle>" to access textstyles.

#Using shapes
- "MaterialTheme.shapes.<shape>"

#Material Design 3 and Material You
- Jetpack Compose offers an implementation of Material Design 3, the next evolution of Material Design.
- It requires addition of dependency to the build.gradle file.

#Custom design systems in Compose(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/themes/custom)
- There are several approaches to create a custom design system:
	- Extending MaterialTheme
	- Replacing one or more Material attributes
	- Implementing a fully custom design system
