#Thinking in compose(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/mental-model)
- Jetpack is a modern declarative UI toolkit for android.

#The declarative programming paradigm:
- Imperative programming creates the likelihood of creating errors like 
       - Forgetting to update one of the views that show a piece of data that is rendered multiple places.
	   - Easy to create illegal state like trying to update a view that was just deleted.
- In declarative programming paradigm, the entire screen is conceptually regenerated from scratch upon state change
- To mitigate the cost(computing power, performance and battery usage) of regenerating the entire screen, compose intellegently chooses 
which part of the UI needs to be regenerated.

#A Simple composable function
- A composable function is used to build UI. It takes data and emits UI elements.
- Composable functions are 1. Annotated by @Composable 
                           2. Accept data
                           3. Emit UI. Does not return anything
						   4. Fast, idempotent and free of Side-effect
						   
#The declarative paradigm shift
- In Compose's declarative approach, widgets are relatively stateless and do not expose setter or getter functions.
- Recomposition - the process that occurs when UI is redrawn as a result of state change.

#Dynamic Content
- Because composable functions are written in Kotlin instead of XML, they can be as dynamic as any other Kotlin code.
- Composables have the full flexibility of the underlying language. This power and flexibility is one of the key advantages of Jetpack Compose.

#Recomposition
- Never depend on side-effects, any change that is visible to the rest of your app,from executing composable functions.
- Be aware of the following things when building a composable.
    - Composable functions can execute in any order.
    - Composable functions can execute in parallel.
    - Recomposition skips as many composable functions and lambdas as possible.
    - Recomposition is optimistic and may be canceled.
    - A composable function might be run quite frequently, as often as every frame of an animation.

#State and Jetpack Compose(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state)
#State and composition
- A state before, the UI changes whenever the composable is envoked with a new argument. These arguments are representation of UI state, as a result 
things like TextField do not update automatically without explicitly being told the new state. 

#States in composables
- There are three ways to declare a "MutableState" object in a composable:
    val mutableState = remember { mutableStateOf(default) }
    var value by remember { mutableStateOf(default) }
    val (value, setValue) = remember { mutableStateOf(default) }
- While remember helps you retain state across recompositions, the state is not retained across configuration changes.
For this, you must use "rememberSaveable"

#Other supported types
- Jetpack Compose doesn't require that you use MutableState<T> to hold state. 
Jetpack Compose supports other observable types. Before reading another observable type in Jetpack Compose, 
you must convert it to a State<T> so that Jetpack Compose can automatically recompose when the state changes.
Compose ships with functions to create State<T> from common observable types used in Android apps:
   -  LiveData
   -  Flow
   -  RxJava2
- It is recommended to use observable data holders like State<List<T>> and immutable listOf()

#Stateful versus stateless
- A composable that uses remember to state internally is called a stateful composable.
- This can be useful in situations where a caller doesn't need to control the state and can use it without having to manage the state themselves.
However, composables with internal state tend to be less reusable and harder to test.
- A composable that does not hold any state is called stateless composable.
An easy way to achieve stateless is by using state hoisting.

#State hoisting
- State hoisting in Compose is a pattern of moving state to a composable's caller to make a composable stateless. 
The general pattern for state hoisting in Jetpack Compose is to replace the state variable with two parameters:-
   - value: T: the current value to display
   - onValueChange: (T) -> Unit: an event that requests the value to change, where T is the proposed new value
- Among the several important properties of a hoisted State, some of the most important ones are:
   - Interceptable
   - Decoupling
- The pattern where the state goes down, and events go up is called a unidirectional data flow.

#Restoring state in Compose
#Ways to store state 
   - Parcelize
   - MapSaver
   - ListSaver   
   
#Managing state in Compose
   - Composable - Simple UI element state managment 
   - State holders - Complex UI element state managment
   - Architecture Componenets ViewModels - Providing access to the business logic and UI state 
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Lifecycle of composables(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle)
#Lifecycle overview
- Composition describes the UI of your app and is produced by running composables.
- Initial Composition -> Recomposition -> Leave Composition
- A Composable's' lifecycle is simpler than the lifecycle of views, activities, and fragments. 
When a composable needs to manage or interact with external resources that do have a more complex lifecycle, you should use effects.

#Anatomy of a composable in Composition
- The instance of a composable in Composition is identified by its "call site".
- The "call site" is the source code location in which a composable is called. This influences its place in Composition, and therefore, the UI tree.

#Add extra information to help smart recompositions
- When calling a composable multiple times from the same call site, Compose doesn’t have any information to uniquely identify each call to that composable,
so the "execution order" is used in addition to the "call site" in order to keep the instances distinct.
- The "key" composable is used to tell the runtime what values you want to use to identify a given part of the tree.
- The value for a key does not need to be globally unique, it needs to only be unique amongst the invocations of composables at the call site.
- Some composables have built-in support for the key composable. For example, LazyColumn accepts specifying a custom key in the items DSL.

#Skipping if the inputs haven't changed
- If a composable is already in the Composition, it can skip recomposition if all the inputs are stable and haven't changed.

- A stable type must comply with the following contract:
   - The result of equals for two instances will forever be the same for the same two instances.
   - If a public property of the type changes, Composition will be notified.
   - All public property types are also stable.
- All primitive value types, Strings and All Function types (lambdas) are stable because they are immutable.
- If Compose is not able to infer that a type is stable, but you want to force Compose to treat it as stable, mark it with the "@Stable annotation".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Compose modifiers(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/modifiers)
- Create a modifier by calling one of the "Modifier class functions".
- You can "chain" these functions together to compose them.
- It's a best practice to have all of your Composables accept a modifier parameter, and pass that modifier to its first child that emits UI.

#Order of modifiers matters
- Since each function makes changes to the Modifierreturned by the previous function, the sequence affects the final result.

#Built-in modifiers
#padding and size
- By default, layouts provided in Compose wrap their children. However, you can set a size by using the size modifier.
- Note that the size you specified might not be respected if it does not satisfy the constraints coming from the layout's parent. 
- If you require the composable size to be fixed regardless of the incoming constraints, use the "requiredSize" modifier:
- When a child does not respect its constraints, the layout system will hide this from the parent. 
The parent will see the child's width and height values as if they were coerced in the constraints provided by the parent. 
- The layout system will then center the child within the space allocated by the parent under the assumption that the child respected the constraints.
Developers can override this centering behaviour by applying "wrapContentSize" modifiers to the child.
- "fillMaxWidth", "fillMaxHeight", "fillMaxSize", "padding", "paddingFromBaseline"

#offset
- To position a layout relative to its original position, add the offset modifier and set the offset in the x and y axis.
- The "difference" between padding and offset is that adding an offset to a composable does not change its measurements.

#Type safety in compose
- "matchParentSize"

#weight in Row and Column
- "weight"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Side-effects in Compose(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects)
#State and effect use cases
- An "effect" is a composable function that doesn't emit UI and causes side effects to run when a composition completes.

#LaunchedEffect: run suspend functions in the scope of a composable

#rememberCoroutineScope: obtain a composition-aware scope to launch a coroutine outside a composable
- Also use rememberCoroutineScope when you want to control the life cycle of a coroutine manually.

#rememberUpdatedState: reference a value in an effect that shouldn't restart if the value changes

#DisposableEffect: effects that require cleanup
- A DisposableEffect must include an onDispose clause as the final statement in its block of code.

#SideEffect: publish Compose state to non-compose code

#produceState: convert non-Compose state into Compose state
- Composables with a return type should be named the way you'd name a normal Kotlin function, starting with a lowercase letter.

#derivedStateOf: convert one or multiple state objects into another state

#snapshotFlow: convert Compose's State into Flows

#Restarting effects

#Constants as keys
- You can use a constant like true as an effect key to make it follow the lifecycle of the call site. 
However, before doing that, think twice and make sure that's what you need.

#Jetpack Compose Phases(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/phases)
#The three phases of a frame
   - Composition                              -> What UI to show
   - Layout (Measurement and placement)       -> Where to place UI
   - Drawing                                  -> How to render

#State reads
#Phased state reads
- What happens when a State value is read within each phase
#1. Composition
- State reads within a @Composable function or lambda block affect composition and potentially the subsequent phases.
- Depending on the result of composition, Compose UI may or may not run the layout and drawing phases.

#2. Layout
- The measurement step runs the measure lambda passed to the Layout composable, the "MeasureScope.measure" method of the LayoutModifier interface, and so on.
The placement step runs the placement block of the layout function, the lambda block of Modifier.offset { … }, and so on.

#3. Drawing
- State reads during drawing code affect the drawing phase. When the state value changes, Compose UI runs only the draw phase.

#Optimizing state reads
- As Compose performs localized state read tracking, we can minimize the amount of work performed by reading each state in an appropriate phase.
Example: using assigning offset in the composition phase vs in the layout phase.
- Try to localize state reads to the lowest possible phase, enabling Compose to perform the minimum amount of work.

#Recomposition loop (cyclic phase dependency)
- Dont use the state as an input to some layout modifier

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Jetpack Compose architectural layering(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layering)
#Layers
- The major layer of Jetpack Compose are: 
   - Material    -> Implementation of the Material Design system for Compose UI, providing a theming system, styled components, ripple indications, icons.
   - Foundation  -> Provides design system agnostic building blocks for Compose UI, like Row and Column, LazyColumn, recognition of particular gestures, etc.
   - UI          -> Fundamentals of the UI toolkit, such as LayoutNode, Modifier, input handlers, custom layouts, and drawing
   - Runtime     -> Fundamentals of the composable runtime such as @Composable, SideEffect, remember, mutableStateOf
- Lowest layer being the Runtime.

#Design Principles
- A guiding principle for Jetpack Compose is to provide small, focused pieces of functionality that can be composed together

This design principles has a number of advantages:-
#Control    
- Move to lower layer for more control with a trade off with complexity

#Customization
- Jetpack Compose reserves the simplest names for the highest level components.

#Picking the right abstraction
- As a rule, prefer building on the highest-level component which offers the functionality you need in order to benefit from the best practices they include.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Semantics in Compose(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/semantics)
- Next to the Composition, there exists a parallel tree, called the Semantics tree.
- This tree describes your UI in an alternative manner that is understandable for Accessibility services and for the Testing framework. 
- If your app consists of composables and modifiers from the Compose foundation and material library, 
the Semantics tree is automatically filled and generated for you. 
- However when you’re adding custom low-level composables, you will have to manually provide its semantics.

#Semantic Properties
- Composables and modifiers that are built on top of the Compose foundation library already set the relevant properties for you. 
Optionally, you can set or override the properties yourself with the "semantics" and "clearAndSetSemantics" modifiers.
- To visualize the Semantics tree, we can use the "Layout Inspector Tool" or use the "printToLog()" method inside our tests. 
- Keeping track of the semantics properties of each composable in your app unlocks a lot of powerful possibilities. Some examples:
   - Talkback uses the properties to read aloud what’s shown on the screen and lets the user smoothly interact with it.
   - The Testing framework uses the properties to find nodes, interact with them, and make assertions.
   
#Merged and unmerged Semantics tree
- To convey the correct meaning of what is shown on the screen, it is also useful to merge certain sub-trees of nodes and treat them as one.
- As a rule of thumb, each node in this tree represents a focusable element when using Accessibility services.
- Composables and modifiers can indicate that they want to merge their descendants' semantics properties by calling 
"Modifier.semantics (mergeDescendants = true){}".
- "clickable", "toggleable", "ListItem" ... internally have the mergeDesendants property set to true.

#Inspecting the tree
- It is possible to inspect both merged and unmerged trees.
- The Testing framework uses the merged tree by default.

#Merging behavior
- An important note is that descendants that themselves have set "mergeDescendants = true" are not included in the merge 
and are shown separately in the merge tree.

#Adapting the Semantics tree
- When you’re creating your own custom components, it is relevant that you can override or clear certain semantics properties, 
or change the merging behavior of the tree.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Locally scoped data with CompositionLocal(URL: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/compositionlocal)
- CompositionLocal is a tool for passing data down through the Composition implicitly.

#Introducing CompositionLocal
- To support not needing to pass data as an explicit parameter dependency to most composables, Compose offers CompositionLocal 
which allows you to create tree-scoped named objects that can be used as an implicit way to have data flow through the UI tree.
- "CompositionLocal" is what the Material theme uses under the hood. 
- MaterialTheme is an object that provides three CompositionLocal instances--"colors", "typography" and "shapes"--allowing you to 
retrieve them later in any descendant part of the Composition.
- CompositionLocal objects or constants are usually prefixed with "Local" to allow better discoverability with auto-complete in the IDE.

#Creating your own CompositionLocal

#Deciding whether to use CompositionLocal
- A CompositionLocal should have a good "default value".
- Avoid CompositionLocal for concepts that aren't thought as tree-scoped or sub-hierarchy scoped. 
A CompositionLocal makes sense when it can be potentially used by any descendant, "not by a few" of them.

#Creating a CompositionLocal
- There are two APIs to create a CompositionLocal:
   - compositionLocalOf        -> recomposes places where the value is read
   - staticCompositionLocalOf  -> recomposes the entire content lambda where the CompositionLocal is provided - use where value change is highly unlikely
   
#Providing values to a CompositionLocal
- The "CompositionLocalProvider" composable binds values to CompositionLocal instances for the given hierarchy. 
To provide a new value to a CompositionLocal, use the "provides" infix function that associates a CompositionLocal key to a value  

#Consuming the CompositionLocal
- "CompositionLocalName.current" returns the value provided by the nearest CompositionLocalProvider that provides a value to that CompositionLocal.
